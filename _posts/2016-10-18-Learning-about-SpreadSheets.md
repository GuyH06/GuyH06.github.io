    <td>This lesson was completely different from all the others ones due to the fact that it was the only lesson this year so far that did not involve any Github, because we only focused on learning how to use spreadsheets properly. This was hard as many of us hadn't used spread sheets before so it was a new experience for a lot of us.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Because it was a completely new topic that many of us had never done before there were a lot of problems that we didn't know how to solve, so we were forced to ask for help from the teacher and other students. To make t easier for us some of the code we needed was on the board so we could copy it but we needed to remember a large amount of it too, and the best way to do this would be to take notes.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>If we do spreadsheets again I will be more prepared going into the lesson as I will be more familiar with the software that I am using, but for new things in the future that I havenâ€™t done before, I will need to take notes and listen very carefully to be able to get through the lesson more independantly.</td>
