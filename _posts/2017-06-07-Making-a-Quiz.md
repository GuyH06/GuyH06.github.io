    <td>This lesson, the instructions on what we had to do were very simple - make a quiz, and to do this there were many different ways to reach the target. They all involved deciding what was the best method to use when trying to find out the overall answer to your quiz. One way to do this was to count up all the answers you gave and which every number had the most of that individual answer, was the one you got. The method I used involved giving each answer a number value and totaling up all the values at the end. Which ever range you total was in is the answer you got.</td>

    <td>The hardest thing about this task was fixing mistakes that I made early on while working with the code that broke the quiz right at the end and then going to fix each small problem at the end after spending a long time trying to find them all, like putting a decimal point in my questions (Q.1) which prevented them from having a number value that could change.
I spent my first homeworks worth of time spent on fixing this and making the quiz function.
After this I spent time making my quiz look presentable by using \n to give every answer on a new line. This took a while because of all the options possible from all 10 questions listed </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The first thing that I will try to do next time as soon as I can is looking at the code I have and trying to see anything that is possible that might break my code. This way I will be able to see it at the start of my coding so I will not have to go back right at the end when I have neary finished and spend a long time trying to find any small possible mistakes that I made. Also when importing my questions from a google doc, I should make them more presentable in a coding sense so I do not have to spend a long time fixing everything that I did before incorrectly.</td>
