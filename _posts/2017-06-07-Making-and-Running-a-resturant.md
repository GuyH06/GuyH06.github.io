    <td> The thing that I struggled with the most in the lesson was getting back to grips with Python after 8 weeks of not doing any, but after a while it was easy to get back in the swing of things and everything fell into place.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The best way to make it easier would be to practise a small amount of Python before the first lesson so that I was familiar with it before the lesson, allowing me to make more progress and get further overall in the lesson.</td>
