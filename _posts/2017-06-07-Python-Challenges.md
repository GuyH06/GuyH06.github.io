    <td>This lesson, the instructions on what we had to do and how to do them where not that clear - other than continuing with our Github page - but one very important thing we were told was how to find out the answer of the question we did not know. The best way to do this without asking the teacher was to search on google, but only use the best and fewest words. For example:
If I wanted to find out how to change the colour of the background I will type "CSS Background Colour" Rather than the words used before.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> The thing that I struggled with the most in the lesson was how to make my picture background stay in one place and not move will I scroll down the page. I managed to achieve this after I used the technique above to find an answer that came from W3 Schools.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I should improve my learning by making sure that I am able to do the work without needing instructions from the teacher as we will not always get them so I need to know how to do it if I can't so I donâ€™t waste lots of time trying to find out what to do.</td>
